<h1>Ecommerce Assignment</h1>

This project comprises a webpage designed to facilitate user interaction. The homepage features a prominent carousel banner showcasing key content. Upon selecting the "Buy Now" option, users are directed to a registration form where they are prompted to input their full name, email address, and contact number. Upon submission, users are prompted to validate their submission via a popup that facilitates OTP verification. Additionally, a higher-order function has been implemented to streamline API calls within the project.
